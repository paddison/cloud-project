# Description

For now, this is a very rough implementation, which will create an 8 bit, 8khz one second long mono wav file. It is possible to specify the frequencies of up to two sine waves.

Later it should be possible to specify the bit rate, the sample rate, several sinewaves and the duration of the file.

If there's enough time, a user might also specify a specific chord, instead of a specific frequency e.g. `D-7` which will then be generated.
